            <p>Hi this is Andy, I am a new graduate from decCodeCamp and I am super excited to start my NEW career as a Full Stack Software Developer.
            </p>
            <p> My road to becoming a Developer might be a little different than most, but I think my story shaped my thought process and gave me some invaluable skills!

            <p>Let's be honest how many of you are thinking, “ Man for an aspiring software developer he sure does have tons of content about his past!” I sure thought that as I put this page together.  While I am proud of my previous career and ready to move on, it would be dishonest to not admit how much my past has shaped me in the present. A naturally curious person, an effective problem solver, a supportive team member, or a team leader, who has collaborated not only across departments or companies, but National borders and cultural gaps. A person who has constantly searched for harder and more challenging task.  If you have a spot on your team for someone with unlimited potential, drop me a line! </p>
